About me
======
I am currently a machine learning scientst in a cool oncology startup. I did my PhD in Tri-Institutional PhD Program in Computational Biology and Medicine and I studied cancer progression and metastasis with high-dimension sequencing and imaging data with machine learning and deep learning. I am interested in applying machine learning to resolve real-life problems. 


Interest
======
Vinyl; Jazz; Bouldering; Record moments
